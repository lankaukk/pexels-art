[Make Pexels Art Here!](https://pexel-art.netlify.app/)

Pexels Art is a React App that fetches from the Pexels API. The typed words serve as a search query for their image database. Using the 'average color' attribute of the corresponding images, a new abstract artwork is created. 

If you would like to get this React app started locally, first fork and clone this repo, then run `npm i && npm start`

You will need to create your wn API Key to access the Pexels API. Creating a key is free and only requires an account. Get started here: https://www.pexels.com/onboarding Once you've got your key, you can paste it in place of the API_KEY variable.
